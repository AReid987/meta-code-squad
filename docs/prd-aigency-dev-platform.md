# Product Requirements Document
## SimpleLLMRouter v2 + @aigency/forge-quality

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** 2026-03-05 | **Owner:** Antonio Reid
**Status:** Approved | **Monorepo:** aigency/ (Turborepo)

---

## 1. Overview

This PRD defines the complete product requirements for two packages developed together inside
the `aigency/` Turborepo:

- **SimpleLLMRouter v2** — intelligent LLM routing gateway with Textual TUI
- **@aigency/forge-quality** — plug-and-play commit quality and security enforcement package

Both packages are designed to be individually open-sourceable, independently installable, and
deeply integrated when used together inside the Aigency monorepo.

---

## 2. SimpleLLMRouter v2 — Product Requirements

### 2.1 User Personas

**P1 — The Aigency Orchestrator (primary)**
Antonio running the Meta Code Squad. Needs 24/7 autonomous operation across 8 providers
with zero manual intervention. Monitors via TUI. Cares about: uptime, token savings, routing
accuracy, visibility.

**P2 — The Self-Hosted Developer**
Solo developer running local AI workflows. Wants provider redundancy, free-tier optimization,
and a beautiful interface to show their setup. Cares about: easy setup, zero cost, documentation.

**P3 — The Open Source AI Builder**
Contributing to or forking the router for custom provider configs. Cares about: clean
architecture, extensibility, test coverage, MIT license.

---

### 2.2 Functional Requirements

#### FR-R01: OpenAI-Compatible Proxy
- The router MUST expose an HTTP API on port 8080 that is drop-in compatible with the OpenAI
  `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- Any client using the OpenAI SDK MUST be able to point `baseURL` at the router with zero
  code changes
- The router MUST pass through all standard request fields: messages, model hint, temperature,
  max_tokens, stream
- The router MAY override the `model` field based on routing decisions regardless of what
  the client requested

#### FR-R02: Provider Registry
- The router MUST support a minimum of 8 providers: Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek,
  Together.ai, Groq, Mistral, Cohere
- Provider configuration MUST be defined in a JSON/YAML file external to the source code
- Each provider config MUST include: name, base_url, api_key env var reference, models array,
  daily_token_limit, requests_per_minute, enabled flag, canary_weight
- Adding a new provider MUST require only a config file change — no code changes

#### FR-R03: Semantic Intent Detection
- The router MUST classify every incoming request into one of: CODE_REVIEW, BUG_FIX,
  ARCHITECTURE, DOCUMENTATION, SIMPLE_CHAT, REASONING, TOOL_CALL, CREATIVE, UNKNOWN
- Classification MUST use local embeddings (no external API call) to achieve < 100ms latency
- Classification confidence score MUST be logged and available in the SSE metrics stream
- Intent MUST map to a preferred provider tier and routing strategy

#### FR-R04: 14-Dimension Complexity Classifier
- The router MUST score every request on 14 dimensions: code, logic, context_length, reasoning,
  creative, safety, tool_calling, multilingual, math, vision, speed, cost, context_window,
  instruction_follow
- Each dimension MUST produce a float score 0.0–1.0
- The aggregate complexity tier MUST be one of: SIMPLE, MEDIUM, COMPLEX, REASONING
- Classifier MUST have > 90% unit test coverage with edge cases documented

#### FR-R05: Cascade Fallback Routing
- The router MUST support cascade routing: attempt cheapest qualifying model first, escalate
  to next tier if quality threshold not met
- Quality threshold MUST be configurable per routing strategy (default 0.75)
- Cascade chain MUST be configurable (default: Flash → Pro → GPT-4o-mini → GPT-4o)
- Cascade escalation events MUST be logged with reason

#### FR-R06: Five Routing Strategies
- The router MUST support five named strategies selectable at runtime:
  - `quality` — maximize response quality; prefer strongest models
  - `cost` — minimize token spend; prefer free tier, smallest models
  - `latency` — minimize TTFB; prefer fastest providers (Groq, Gemini Flash)
  - `balanced` — weighted composite of quality, cost, latency
  - `simple-shuffle` — round-robin across healthy providers (useful for load testing)
- Active strategy MUST be changeable via REST PATCH without router restart
- Active strategy MUST be visible and editable in the TUI Router Config screen

#### FR-R07: Quota Tracker
- The router MUST track token consumption per provider per day
- QuotaTracker MUST be wired into the main request handler (currently unconnected — critical fix)
- When a provider reaches the warning threshold (default 80%), it MUST be deprioritized in routing
- When a provider reaches the hard cutoff (default 95%), it MUST be excluded from routing
- Quota state MUST persist across restarts (SQLite)
- Quota MUST reset on provider's reset schedule (default: daily at 00:00 UTC)

#### FR-R08: Circuit Breaker
- Each provider MUST have an independent circuit breaker
- Circuit opens after 3 consecutive failures within a 60-second window
- Open circuit MUST exclude the provider from routing for a configurable cooldown (default 120s)
- Circuit state: CLOSED (healthy), OPEN (excluded), HALF-OPEN (testing recovery)
- Circuit state MUST be visible per provider in the TUI Quota Manager screen

#### FR-R09: Three-Layer Cache
- **L1 In-Memory Cache:** exact match on `hash(model_tier + normalized_prompt)`, TTL 5 minutes,
  max 1000 entries (LRU eviction)
- **L2 Disk Cache:** exact match persisted to SQLite, TTL 24 hours, max 10GB
- **L3 Semantic Cache:** embedding-based similarity match using hnswlib, threshold 0.92,
  TTL 72 hours; embeddings computed locally using a lightweight model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Cache lookup MUST check L1 → L2 → L3 in order; first hit wins
- Cache hit MUST be logged with layer (L1/L2/L3) and similarity score
- All cache layers MUST be independently flushable via CLI and TUI

#### FR-R10: Memory-Augmented Routing
- The router MUST store a rolling history of routing decisions (last 10,000 requests)
- For each new request, router MUST check if a similar past request was routed successfully
- If a high-confidence match exists (similarity > 0.88), the historically successful provider
  MUST be weighted higher in the routing decision
- History MUST persist across restarts (SQLite)

#### FR-R11: OptiLLM Integration
- The router MUST support optional routing through an OptiLLM proxy for enhanced inference
- OptiLLM integration MUST be gated by: `OPTILLM_ENABLED=true` env var and complexity
  threshold (default: COMPLEX and REASONING tiers only)
- If OptiLLM is unreachable, the router MUST fall through to direct provider call
- OptiLLM technique selection MUST be automatic based on intent: MCTS for reasoning,
  self-consistency for code, chain-of-thought for architecture

#### FR-R12: Prompt Template System
- The router MUST support a template registry loaded from a `templates/` directory
- Templates MUST use `{{variable}}` Handlebars-style syntax
- Templates MUST support partials via `{{> partial-name}}` include syntax
- Template resolution MUST occur before the request is forwarded to the provider
- Built-in templates MUST include: code-review, bug-fix, architecture, documentation, chat

#### FR-R13: SSE Metrics Stream
- The router MUST expose a Server-Sent Events endpoint at `/metrics/stream`
- The stream MUST emit events for: every routing decision, cache hits/misses, quota updates,
  circuit breaker state changes, provider errors
- Event format MUST be JSON with fields: timestamp, event_type, provider, model, latency_ms,
  tokens, intent, complexity, cache_layer, error (if any)
- The TUI MUST consume this stream exclusively for all live data
