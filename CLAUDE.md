# CLAUDE.md — Meta Code Squad
## Session Context for Claude Code
**Repo:** `/Users/antonioreid/CODE/00_PROJECTS/meta-code-squad`
**Owner:** Antonio Reid
**Read this first every session. It is ground truth.**

---

## Who You Are in This System

You are one execution agent in a layered autonomous development squad. You are NOT the orchestrator. Your specific role is **complex logic, security-sensitive code, state machines, and the ruflo nervous system itself**. Everything else routes elsewhere.

### The Execution Hierarchy

| Agent | Your Job Here | When to Use |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Gemini CLI** | Primary throughput — GSD planning, tests, config, boilerplate, docs | Default for most tasks |
| **Claude Code (you)** | Complex logic, state machines, auth, security, ruflo internals | When Gemini hits complexity ceiling |
| **Kimi Code CLI** | 128K full-codebase review sweeps | Code review, not generation |
| **Qwen / Roo / iFlow** | Quota overflow buffer | Auto-routed by SimpleLLMRouter |

Do not try to do everything. Route correctly.

## The Stack (always running when `just dev` is active)

```
:8080  SimpleLLMRouter v2  — all LLM calls proxy through here
:8283  Letta Server        — stateful codebase memory
       Sugar AI            — persistent task queue (Ralph loop, 24/7)
       Loki Mode           — RARV kanban execution cycle
       Ruflo               — 12 daemon workers, context autopilot, MCP tools
```

**If any of these are down:** run `just status` then `just dev` to restart.

## How Tasks Flow (do not skip steps)

```
Antonio drops intent
       ↓
Gemini CLI runs /gsd → produces PLAN-N.md
       ↓
`just run PLAN-N.md` → Loki RARV cycle picks it up
       ↓
Loki assigns to agents (you, Gemini, Kimi) per task type
       ↓
Sugar AI tracks state, persists across sessions
       ↓
Kanban auto-advances on quality gate pass
       ↓
`just review` → Kimi does full-codebase sweep before merge
```

## Memory Protocol

- **Letta** owns codebase memory. On first session: run `/init deep`. After that it learns passively.
- **Ruflo** owns swarm/agent memory and context compaction. Fires automatically via hooks.
- **Sugar** owns task queue state. Cross-session, never loses position.
- You do NOT need to re-explain context at session start. The daemons maintain it.

If context feels stale: run `/remember` to force a Letta learning pass.

## Key Conventions

- **All LLM calls** route through `http://localhost:8080` (SimpleLLMRouter). Never call provider APIs directly.
- **Python tools** (Sugar, Letta) use `.venv/` at repo root. Never system Python.
- **Commits trigger** Letta `/remember` + Ruflo memory checkpoint automatically (git hook).
- **Quality gates** are Loki's job. Do not merge without `just review` passing.
- **Maestra is Phase 3.** Do not introduce workflow engine concepts before Phase 2 is complete.

## If Something Breaks

1. `just status` — see what's down
2. `just stop && just dev` — full restart
3. `just doctor` — verify all binaries present
4. Check `.letta/memory/` — if corrupted, run `letta code reset && just init-letta`
5. Check `sugar task list` — if queue is stale, run `sugar reset`
